# Cursor Rules for 3D Product Viewer

## Project Description

This project is a 3D product viewer application built with Next.js App Router, React, and Three.js. It allows users to upload an image and map it onto a 3D cube. Users can also enter text that will be rendered as a 3D text object above the cube. The application provides controls to rotate, pan, and zoom the 3D model.

## Key Components

- app/layout.tsx: The root layout component that provides the base HTML structure and global styles.
- app/page.tsx: The main page component that brings everything together and manages the state for the uploaded image, rotation toggle, and product text.
- ImageUpload.tsx: Handles the image upload functionality.
- ProductViewer.tsx: Renders the 3D scene using react-three-fiber.
- Product.tsx: Represents the 3D cube model and maps the uploaded image texture onto it. Also renders the 3D text.
- ProductControls.tsx: Provides a button to toggle the auto-rotation of the 3D model.
- TextInput.tsx: Allows the user to enter text that will be rendered as a 3D text object.

## Usage Instructions

1. Upload a product image using the upload area.
2. Enter the desired product text in the input field.
3. The uploaded image will be mapped onto a 3D cube, and the entered text will be rendered as a 3D text object above the cube.
4. Use the mouse to interact with the 3D model:
   - Left click and drag to rotate manually.
   - Right click and drag to pan.
   - Scroll to zoom in/out.
5. Use the "Start Rotation" / "Stop Rotation" button to toggle the auto-rotation of the model.
